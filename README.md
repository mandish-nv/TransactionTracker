The “Transaction Tracker” project is a solution designed to simulate the operations of a transaction environment. The project aims to address the challenges arising from the decentralized nature of financial transactions in today's digital economy. It faces the problems by aiming to monitor, record, and manage financial transactions and store them in a centralized location. The users are able to send money to the desired user and the necessary information is also correctly updated in the database based on the money transacted. 
The project on “Transaction Tracker” is in Java language using MySQL as database software. The main goal of the project is to perform money transaction between users within the system. In each process, the validity of the user, amount to transfer and password are checked for verification purposes. Every transaction and user information is also stored permanently using database.
The advantage of “Transaction Tracker” is that the program will be user-friendly, will be able to store the records of user and log history of the successful transactions and maintains integrity as it correctly updates the balance for the users involved in the transaction. The objective of this program was achieved using the implementation of MySQL database.
